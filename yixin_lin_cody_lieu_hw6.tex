\section{Introduction}

Our goal in this paper is to investigate the following questions:

First, which types of error fail first when enough noise is added for the shape to be unrecognizable?

Second, what happens when we change the image resolution but keep \texttt{simga} fixed?

\section{Progression of failure with increasing levels of noise}
